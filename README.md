# Mercat Catala
Set of scripts for parsing, saving and uploading to a personally-owned database all the cultural events listed in the Catalan Government's website http://agenda.cultura.gencat.cat/ Also, once we have all that data, use it in a social network style website (intended to be named mercatcatala.cat) for editing, commenting, liking/disliking, etc. the events among the website users.

- Languages and techniques used: PHP, Javascript, Ajax, SQL, HTML, CSS
- Libraries used: script.aculo.us, Snoopy

_A fairly detailed description of the code structure can be found at Mem√≤ria_escrita.pdf, although it's in Catalan. I will soon start translating it to English. However, I originally wrote the code (comments and variable names) in Catalan, and that will probably still make it hard to read for most part of the people._

_Also, a document (in Catalan) showing the necessary steps to follow in order to set up the project into your own web server, can be found at LLEGEIX-ME.txt_
